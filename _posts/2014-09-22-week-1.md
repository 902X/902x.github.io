	This week we have built our U shape base and added normal wheels in preperation for the parade that we had this past Sunday.The parade was a sucess, we raised $40 in donations and got some extra driving practice. Sadly only Joey, Kolby, and I (Cat) could attend. Today Atticus and I changed all of our motors to speed and attached a few omni wheels. William worked on the model for the 8 bar lift. Kolby and Joey worked on the programming and sorting out our laptop. Finally, Mathew and Porter worked on the online challenges. We definetly still need to find our jobs but they have almost decided for themselves based off of what they do each day, William, Atticus, Sam, and I will be building. kolby, Andrew and Joey will be doing whatever is needed. Mathew and porter will be working with computer/online challenges. Anyway for week one I think we're off to a smooth start!
