## Robot Parade

This week we have built our U-shaped base and added normal wheels in preperation for the parade that we had this past Sunday. The parade was a sucess, we raised $40 in donations and got some extra driving practice. Sadly only Joey, Kolby, and I (Cat) could attend.

## Progress

Today Atticus and I changed all of our motors to speed and attached a few omni wheels. William worked on the model for the 8 bar lift. Kolby and Joey worked on the programming and sorting out our laptop. Finally, Mathew and Porter worked on the online challenges. 

## Future

We definetly still need to find our jobs but they have almost decided for themselves based off of what they do each day, William, Atticus, Sam, and I will be building. kolby, Andrew and Joey will be doing whatever is needed. Mathew and porter will be working with computer/online challenges. Anyway for week one I think we're off to a smooth start!
