Today we continued working on the 8 bar lift and have almost finished redoing our base and putting on mecanum wheels. Kolby has completely programmed the wheels, but Cat messed up the 8 bar. She bent one of the peices of metal, and now we (I, Will) have to do it all over again. Our robot shuold be done in at most 2 months, but I'm hoping for 5 weeks.
