	This is our first year all on a team together and we couldn't be more excited about it! This year's Vex challenge will not be an easy one but so far we have a strong design and the people willing to make it happen! On our team we have a very well rounded group with people ready and willing to design, build, program, drive, scout, and eventually compete. I don't think I've been this excited for a robotics season and I'm pretty sure I speak for everyone on the team when I say this season is going to be a great one!
