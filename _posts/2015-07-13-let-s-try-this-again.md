We have just begun preperation for another season of robotics! This year we have a team of six and it is still very well rounded. For anyone reading these My name is Catherine or Cat and I do evrything to do with the website, so I will be writing these updates. THese updates will be a sumarization of what was written in our engineering journal for the day. This week we are at camp to get started on the robot so we will have a few updates before the fall once the season officially starts.
